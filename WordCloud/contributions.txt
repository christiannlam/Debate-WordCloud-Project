Christian Lam - 55
Gideon Essel - 45

Overall to finish the assignment we met up in person and had phone calls to work on this assignment. The WordFrequency.java file was writen by Gideon
and Christian looked over it and fixed a couple things like the constructors. On the DebateWord cloud class Christian
wrote all the methods except for the increaseFrequency method. Gideon wrote the increaseFrequency method and implemented alternative suggestions
for some of the methods Christian worked on, but in the end Christian would implement the methods in a manner that better suited our logic.
